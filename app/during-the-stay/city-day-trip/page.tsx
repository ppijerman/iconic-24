            After the conference sessions conclude, we invite you to join us for
            a city day trip that will unveil the scientific legacy of Göttingen.
            Wander through the streets that once inspired great minds like
            Gauss, Planck, and Röntgen. Our tour will take you on a journey
            where science and culture intertwine, with stops at key historical
            sites and local cafes. Stay tuned for more details and prepare to
            connect with history and your fellow attendees in a relaxed and
            inspiring atmosphere.
